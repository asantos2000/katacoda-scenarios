To clone a Git repo in the Cloud Shell, you need to create a personal access token and use it as the username. Once you have your token, clone the repository as follows:
`git clone https://<your-access-token>@github.com/username/repo.git`{{copy}}


#### Exit the shell
Type `exit`{{copy}} to terminate the session.
