The Azure CLI's default authentication method uses a web browser and access token to sign in.

Run the login command.
`az login`{{execute}} 

1. If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load a sign-in page.

    Otherwise, you need to open a browser page and follow the instructions on the command line to enter an authorization code after navigating to https://aka.ms/devicelogin in your browser.

2. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
